# panki examples

This directory contains example projects that showcase the different ways that a
`panki` project can be structured. You can refer to these projects for ideas
when building and scaling your own projects.

The following example projects are available:
  - [`basic/`]: This is the basic project created in the "Getting Started"
    section of the readme.
  - [`intermediate/`]: This is a more intermediate project that builds on top of
    the [`basic/`] project to include things like multi-file configuration,
    additional note types, reverse cards, and additional data.
